  abstract  = {Although group (IV–VII) nonmetallic elements do not favor interacting with anionic species, there are counterexamples including the halogen bond. Such binding is known to be related to the charge deficiency because of the adjacent atom's electron withdrawing effect, which creates s/p-holes at the bond-ends. However, a completely opposite behavior is exhibited by N2 and O2, which have electrostatically positive/negative character around cylindrical-bond-surface/bond-ends. Inspired by this, here we elucidate the unusual features and origin of the anisotropic noncovalent interactions in the ground and excited states of the 2nd and 3rd row elements belonging to groups IV–VII. The anisotropy in charge distributions and van der Waals radii of atoms in such molecular systems are scrutinized. This provides an understanding of their unusual molecular configuration, binding and recognition modes involved in new types of molecular assembling and engineering. This work would lead to the design of intriguing molecular systems exploiting anisotropic noncovalent interactions.},

  abstract  = {A method for calculating approximately the coupling energy of weakly interacting fragments is presented. The method is a simplified version of the density-functional scheme of Kohn and Sham and is applicable whenever the electron density of the coupled fragments does not deviate too markedly from a sum of isolated fragment densities. The coupling energy is expressed directly in terms of properties of the isolated fragments and the only nontrivial computational step is the determination of an eigenvalue sum for the coupled system with a fixed potential. Neither self-consistency cycling nor a solution of Poisson’s equation for the coupled fragments is required. The method is therefore particularly appropriate when full density-functional calculations are tractable for the isolated fragments but difficult for the coupled system, e.g., a molecule interacting with a surface. Explicit calculations for dimers illustrate that the approach is very accurate for weakly interacting systems, and that reasonable results can be obtained even for strong covalent bonds.},

  abstract  = {The simplified energy functional of Harris has given results of useful accuracy for systems well outside the limits of weakly interacting fragments for which the method was originally proposed. In the present study, we discuss the source of the frequent good agreement of the Harris energy with full Kohn-Sham self-consistent results. A procedure is described for extending the applicability of the scheme to more strongly interacting systems by going beyond the frozen-atom fragment approximation. A gradient-force expression is derived, based on the Harris functional, which accounts for errors in the fragment charge representation. Results are presented for some diatomic molecules, illustrating the points of this study.},

  abstract    = {Given sufficient examples, recently introduced machine learning models enable rapid, yet accurate, predictions of properties of new molecules. Extrapolation to larger molecules with differing composition is prohibitive due to all the specific chemistries which would be required for training. We address this problem by exploiting redundancies due to chemical similarity of repeating building blocks each represented by an effective {\underline a}tom in {\underline m}olecule: The "am-on". In analogy to the DNA sequence in a gene encoding its function, constituting amons encode a query molecule's properties. The use of amons affords highly accurate machine learning predictions of quantum properties of arbitrary query molecules in real time. We investigate this approach for predicting energies of various covalently and non-covalently bonded systems. After training on the few amons detected, very low prediction errors can be reached, on par with experimental uncertainty. Systems studied include two dozen large biomolecules, eleven thousand medium sized organic molecules, large common polymers, water clusters, doped $h$BN sheets, bulk silicon, and Watson-Crick DNA base pairs. Conceptually, the amons extend Mendeleev's table to account for the chemical environments of elements. They represent an important stepping stone to machine learning based virtual chemical space exploration campaigns.},

  abstract    = {One of the molecular properties most intuitive to the human perception is the geometrical shape. However, when exploring a large chemical space the determination of shape needs to be automated. We present a fast and simple approach to identify a molecule as linear, planar, cube, cuboid, disk, elliptical disk, spheroid and sphere which is more fine grained than existing approaches. The method is applied to more than one billion molecules ranging from small organic molecules to whole proteins. The results show that current chemistry research is biased towards planar geometries. Moreover, we demonstrate that our molecular shape classification correlates with sought-after properties like the band gap, dipole moment, and heat capacity. This allows to increase the efficiency of molecular design studies by driving high-throughput-screening efforts towards desired values of molecular properties.},

  abstract    = {Based on thermodynamic integration we introduce atoms in molecules (AIM) using the orbital-free framework of alchemical perturbation density functional theory (APDFT). Within APDFT, atomic energies and electron densities in molecules are arbitrary because any arbitrary reference system and integration path can be selected as long as it meets the boundary conditions. We choose the uniform electron gas as the most generic reference, and linearly scale up all nuclear charges, situated at any query molecule's atomic coordinates. Within the approximations made when calculating one-particle electron densities, this choice affords exact and unambiguous definitions of energies and electron densities of AIMs We illustrate the approach for neutral iso-electronic diatomics (CO, N$_2$, BF), various small molecules with different electronic hybridisation states of carbon (CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN), and for all the possible BN doped mutants connecting benzene to borazine (C$_{2n}$B$_{3-n}$N$_{3-n}$H$_6$, $0 \le n \le 3$). Analysis of the numerical results obtained suggests that APDFT based AIMs enable meaningful and new interpretations of molecular energies and electron densities.},

  abstract      = {Automatic differentiation is a tool for numerically calculating derivatives of a given function up to machine precision. This tool is useful for quantum chemistry methods, which require the calculation of gradients either for the minimization of the energy with respect to wave function parameters or for the calculation of molecular responses to external perturbations. Herein, we apply automatic differentiation to the coupled cluster with doubles method, in which the wave function parameters are obtained by minimizing the energy Lagrangian. The benefit of this approach is that the l amplitudes can be obtained without implementation of the usual L-equations, thereby reducing the coding effort by approximately a factor of two. We also show that the excitation energies at the coupled cluster level can be ontained with only a few lines of the code using automatic differentiation. We further apply automatic differentiation to the multicomponent coupled cluster with doubles method, which treats more than one type of particle, such as electrons and protons, quantum mechanically. This approach will be especially useful for prototyping, debugging, and testing multicomponent quantum chemistry methods because reference and benchmark data are limited in this emerging field.},

  abstract      = {Doping compounds can be considered a perturbation to the nuclear charges in a molecular Hamiltonian. Expansions of this perturbation in a Taylor series, i.e. quantum alchemy, has been used in literature to assess millions of derivative compounds at once rather than enumerating them in costly quantum chemistry calculations. So far, it was unclear whether this series even converges for small molecules, whether it can be used for geometry relaxation and how strong this perturbation may be to still obtain convergent numbers. This work provides numerical evidence that this expansion converges and recovers the self-consistent energy of Hartree-Fock calculations. The convergence radius of this expansion is quantified for dimer examples and systematically evaluated for different basis sets, allowing for estimates of the chemical space that can be covered by perturbing one reference calculation alone. Besides electronic energy, convergence is shown for density matrix elements, molecular orbital energies, and density profiles, even for large changes in electronic structure, e.g. transforming He$_3$ into H$_6$. Subsequently, mixed alchemical and spatial derivatives are used to relax H$_2$ from the electronic structure of He alone, highlighting a path to spatially relaxed quantum alchemy. Finally, the underlying code (APHF) which allows for arbitrary precision evaluation of restricted Hartree-Fock energies and arbitrary-order derivatives is made available to support future method development.},

  abstract    = {Computational quantum mechanics based molecular and materials design campaigns consume increasingly more high-performance compute resources, making improved job scheduling efficiency desirable in order to reduce carbon footprint or wasteful spending. We introduce quantum machine learning (QML) models of the computational cost of common quantum chemistry tasks. For single point, geometry optimization, and transition state calculations the out of sample prediction error of QML models of wall times decays systematically with training set size. We present numerical evidence for thousands of organic molecular systems including closed and open shell equilibrium structures, as well as transition states. Levels of electronic structure theory considered include B3LYP/def2-TZVP, MP2/6-311G(d), local CCSD(T)/VTZ-F12, CASSCF/VDZ-F12, and MRCISD+Q-F12/VDZ-F12. In comparison to conventional indiscriminate job treatment, QML based wall time predictions significantly improve job scheduling efficiency for all tasks after training on just thousands of molecules. Resulting reductions in CPU time overhead range from 10% to 90%.},
